Phase 1: Project Planning & Requirements
Define Objectives & Scope:


Predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) via regression


Establish key metrics: RMSE for regression


Dataset Identification:


Consider public datasets like the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set, SECOM Manufacturing Data Set (UCI), or a simulated dataset from Kaggle.


Tech Stack & AWS Services:


Ingestion/Storage: Amazon S3, AWS IoT Core or Kinesis (if simulating real-time data).


Data Processing: AWS Glue or SageMaker Processing Jobs.


Model Training: SageMaker Training Jobs with support for algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or deep learning frameworks for LSTMs/RNNs.


Deployment: SageMaker Endpoints or Batch Transform Jobs.


Monitoring: Amazon CloudWatch and SageMaker Model Monitor.


Orchestration: AWS EventBridge for job scheduling and automation.



Phase 2: Data Ingestion & Storage
Setup Data Storage:


Create one or more S3 buckets to store raw sensor data and processed data.


Ingestion Pipeline (Optional for Real-time):


For simulated real-time data, set up AWS IoT Core or Kinesis Data Streams to collect sensor data continuously and upload to S3.



Phase 3: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Data Cleaning:


Remove or impute missing values and outliers.


Feature Engineering:


Generate time-series features like rolling averages, standard deviations, and lag features to capture temporal dependencies.


Tools & Processing:


Use AWS Glue for batch ETL operations or SageMaker Processing Jobs for more integrated processing in your ML workflow.



Phase 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visual Analysis:


Utilize Jupyter notebooks (e.g., in SageMaker Studio) to visualize sensor data trends, correlations, and potential anomalies.


Insights & Hypotheses:


Identify key drivers of failure, determine seasonality, and assess feature importance to steer model development.



Phase 5: Model Development & Training
Algorithm Selection:


Regression: Utilize methods like Gradient Boosting or Random Forest if predicting RUL.


Classification: Consider models such as Random Forests or even deep learning models (LSTMs) if you aim to classify failure events.


Training Pipeline:


Develop training scripts using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn.


Use SageMaker Training Jobs to launch distributed training.


Implement hyperparameter tuning (possibly with SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning) to optimize model performance.


Versioning:


Store code, data, and model versions in a version control system (like Git) and consider integrating with SageMaker Model Registry.



Phase 6: Pipeline Automation with SageMaker Pipelines
Pipeline Construction:


Orchestrate data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment steps using SageMaker Pipelines.


Workflow Definition:


Define a pipeline that includes:


Data Ingestion/Processing


Model Training


Evaluation and Validation


Model Registration for deployment if performance criteria are met


Documentation:


Use well-documented pipeline code and notebooks to ensure reproducibility.



Phase 7: Model Deployment
Deployment Options:


On-Demand Predictions: Deploy your trained model as a SageMaker Endpoint for real-time inference.


Batch Processing: Use SageMaker Batch Transform for periodic large-scale inference.


API & Integration:


Build a RESTful API (using Flask, FastAPI, or another framework) hosted on Replit to interact with the deployed endpoint.


Configure the API to receive incoming data, forward requests to the SageMaker Endpoint, and return predictions.



Phase 8: Monitoring & Model Retraining
Monitoring Infrastructure:


Set up Amazon CloudWatch to track endpoint latency, throughput, and error rates.


Implement SageMaker Model Monitor to continuously evaluate prediction accuracy and detect data drift.


Alerting & Logging:


Configure CloudWatch alarms for deviations in performance metrics.


Log metrics and prediction outcomes for later analysis and troubleshooting.


Automation & Feedback Loop:


Schedule periodic reprocessing and retraining jobs using AWS EventBridge to automate retraining based on new data or performance drift.


Incorporate a feedback loop that updates your model registry and redeploys improved models automatically.



Phase 9: Orchestration, Testing & Deployment on Replit
Local Development:


Develop and test your initial data processing and API integration on Replit.


Use mock data to simulate sensor inputs and verify the end-to-end workflow.


Integration:


Connect your Replit environment with AWS services via proper API calls and credentials management.


Testing:


Write unit and integration tests for each component of your pipeline, ensuring data flows correctly from ingestion to prediction.


Documentation & CI/CD:


Maintain detailed documentation of the setup, code, and troubleshooting guides.


Optionally, set up CI/CD pipelines (for example, using GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployments.



Phase 10: Post-Deployment and Iteration
Performance Review:


Regularly review CloudWatch dashboards and Model Monitor reports to assess performance.


Gather user feedback and operational data for continual improvement.


Maintenance:


Adjust pipeline parameters and retrain models as more data becomes available.


Plan periodic audits to check for data drift, changes in equipment behavior, or new failure modes.
